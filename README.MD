# The Electron

After some changes in the electron the beta versions are almost impossible to import some modules, and this is terrible

# A manager for Minecraft Bedrock Server

those who do not want to let write commands and stuff on a black screen we have a GUI that can help with that.

The Bds manger GUI is designed to help and keep the game safe while using the server.

one thing helps us is to make backups start and send commands in addition to power: stop, start and restart the server safely.

with just one, next, next you have a manager that will help you keep a server with the latest versions available to play and control.
