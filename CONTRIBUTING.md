to collaborate with the project you can fork or even use the repository itself

1. new contributors must create a new branch with their name plus the name dev, example: `exmplo_dev`.

2. after creating the branch Just create a pull request with the details and modifications added to the files.


---------

Commits should preferably be in English, but can be in Portuguese from Portugal or Portuguese from Brazil.

The programming languages ​​must match those of the repository, this implies for new programming languages, we currently only support html, and javascript. but also like CSS and json to store some values ​​and files.


the stable versions should be in English and with the latest versions of the dependencies of the npm modules.

The stable versions are moderated by the main maintainers of the project.

The pull requests should always be for the `dev` branch. not the `stable` branch. since the stable branches must be to update to a stable version of the project.
