Updates are very important not only for new features, but also for improvements and bug fixes.

Currently we have as main support the latest versions of Minecraft Bedrock Server, new features will be implemented to keep up.

Bds manger will also be compatible with all versions, but our updates are extremely important to keep the user updated. and be against third party apps and bugs.

currently we only support versions above 1.0.0, the dev versions must always be the last one due to code instability.
